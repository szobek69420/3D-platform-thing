## Depencencies
You only need to have a 32-bit libX11 installed on your system to run this ~~monstrocity~~ masterpiece.<br>
<br>
## How to run it
Once you cloned the repo, you need to install the dependencies by typing:<br>
  cd src<br>
  make install<br>
<br>
And now you need to build the project like this (we're still in the src directory):<br>
  make amogus<br>
<br>
The program is now built and can be found in the src/build folder. Alternatively you can run it by typing the following:<br>
  ./build/program<br>
<br>
## Controls
Move around - WASD<br>
Look around - Arrow keys (i'm sorry)<br>
Build and unbuild - 'E' and 'Q' keys<br>
Zoom - 'C'<br>
Reset position - 'R'<br>
Flee - Escape<br>
