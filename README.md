## Depencencies
You only need to have a 32-bit libX11 installed on your system to run this ~~monstrocity~~ masterpiece.

## How to run it
Once you cloned the repo, you need to install the dependencies by typing:
  cd src
  make install

And now you need to build the project like this (we're still in the src directory):
  make amogus

The program is now built and can be found in the src/build folder. Alternatively you can run it by typing the following:
  ./build/program

## Controls
Move around - WASD
Look around - Arrow keys (i'm sorry)
Build and unbuild - 'E' and 'Q' keys
Zoom - 'C'
Reset position - 'R'
Flee - Escape
